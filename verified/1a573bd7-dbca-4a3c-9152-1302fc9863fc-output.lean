We formalized and proved the statement that the complex Gamma function has no zeros on its domain (the complex plane excluding non-positive integers). The proof relies on the integral representation for the right half-plane and the functional equation $\Gamma(s+1) = s\Gamma(s)$ to extend the non-vanishing property to the rest of the domain. Note that the second paragraph of the problem description regarding polynomials $K_n(x)$ appeared to be extraneous context or a separate problem, as the user's proposed formalization and notes focused exclusively on the Gamma function's zeros.

The Gamma function has no zeros in the complex plane (except at non-positive integers where it is undefined/singular, but here we assume s is not a non-positive integer).
